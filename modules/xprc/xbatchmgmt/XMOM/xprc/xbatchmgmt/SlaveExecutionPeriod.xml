    <Documentation>SlaveExecutionPeriod specifies the reoccurring start times of slave orders thus restricting the rate they are started with. 

The different options are:
* Fixed Interval (relative to previous execution)
* Fixed Date (not relative to previous execution)

The start times are always relative to the time window specification the master order may have.

The options differ in their handling of delays that could be caused by
* Factory restart
* Missing capacities
* Time window closing
* etc.</Documentation>
