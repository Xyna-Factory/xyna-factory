# How to use this app

## Plugin tab

When the service group *xfmg.tmf.constraint.ConstraintMgmt* is deployed, the plugin for the constraints table is automatically registered at the Zeta Plugin Management.
For the plugin tab to appear, the GuiHttp application has to be restarted. This can be done from the command line
```bash
$ ./xynafactory.sh stopapplication GuiHttp &amp;lt;application version&amp;gt;
$ ./xynafactory.sh startapplication GuiHttp &amp;lt;application version&amp;gt;
```
After that, open a data type and check if the tab "TMF Constraints" appears.

The same applies for deactivation. Undeploy the service group and restart the GuiHttp to disable the plugin.

## Content description

* *xfmg.tmf.constraint* contains the main service group, the table workflows and the data types for the table data
* *xfmg.tmf.constraint.uidefinition* contains the workflows to create the form definitions of all the UI elements to be displayed (Workflow-defined UI).
* the data types in *xfmg.tmf.constraint.data_model* are used for a one-to-one mapping of the constraints in JSON to xyna data types

## Status and additional comments

* the modeller caches the form definition workflows, a refresh of the browser window may be required for the the changes to take effect

#### Modifying entries:

* after editing table entries the button "Apply Changes" only changes the current unsaved state of the constraints meta data
* to make changes persistent, the data type has to be deployed as usual
* the same applies to adding and deleting entries
