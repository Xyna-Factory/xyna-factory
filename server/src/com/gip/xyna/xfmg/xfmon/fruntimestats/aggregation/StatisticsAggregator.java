/**
 * An AggregationStack is built from the TopDown with the first {@link StatisticsAggregator} being the one that will
 * be executed last. The generic parameter {@link I} specifies the aggregation input while {@link O} specifies the
 * aggregation output. When setting the next aggregation step via {@link StatisticsAggregator}.setNextAggregationPart the 
 * output has to match the input.
 * During AggregationStack traversal the {@link StatisticsMapper} will be called once for every encountered value
 * and afterwards the {@link StatisticsReducer} will be invoked for all mapped results. 
 * It is possible to define type unsafe recursive aggregations by setting the next part to the current aggregator,
 * so defined aggregations can not be registered as they would lead to endless recursions.
 * There are some type unsafe default Mappers ({@link PredefinedStatisticsMapper}) and Reducers
 * ({@link PredefinedStatisticsReducer}) that can be type cast (with {@link PredefinedStatisticsReducer}.typeCast).
 * In most cases only the lowest levels of an AggregationStack will have to be defined, such stacks can be completed
 * with {@link AggregationStatisticsFactory}.completeAggregationStack.
